# lead_scoring_case_study

**Lead Scoring Case study**

This project involves building a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to potential leads, which can be used by the company to target potential leads with a high probability of conversion (>80%).

Objective The main objective of this project is to identify key factors that impact lead conversion rates and provide actionable insights for the company to improve its marketing initiatives.

Methodology The following steps were performed:

1. Data Understanding, Cleaning, and Preparation
2. Train-Test Split and Scaling
3. Model Building
4. Model Evaluation
5. Key Factors Impacting Lead Conversion Rates

**Key Findings**

The logistic regression model identified the following key factors that impact lead conversion rates:

1. Leads assigned the tag "closed by horizon" had the highest probability of conversion.
2. Leads assigned the tag "Lost" also contributed to conversion to a considerable extent.
3. Leads assigned the tag "will revert after reading the mail" had a significant correlation with conversion.

Overall time spent on the website, lead origin from landing page submission, lead source from the business website, Olark Chat, and Last Activity from SMS Sent had a positive effect on conversion rates.

The company should prioritize leads whose lead source is from the "Welingak Website" and generate as many leads as possible through this region.

To enhance the visitor experience, lengthen the time spent on the platform, and increase lead conversion rates, it is also advisable to ask the development team to improve the user interface of the company's app.

Model Performance The logistic regression model achieved the following performance metrics on the train and test sets:

Accuracy: 92.6% (train), 91.4% (test) Sensitivity: 91.8% (train), 89.8% (test) Specificity: 93.1% (train), 92.2% (test) Precision: 89.3% (train), 86.8% (test) Recall: 91.8% (train), 89.8% (test) F1_score: 90.5% (train), 88.3% (test)

Conclusion The logistic regression model identified key factors that impact lead conversion rates and provide actionable insights for the company to improve its marketing initiatives. The findings of this project can be used to prioritize leads and allocate resources effectively to achieve maximum ROI.
